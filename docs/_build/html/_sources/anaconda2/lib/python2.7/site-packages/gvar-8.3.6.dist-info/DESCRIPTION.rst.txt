This package facilitates the creation and manipulation of arbitrarily
complicated (correlated) multi-dimensional Gaussian random variables.
The random variables are represented by a new data type that can be used
in arithmetic expressions and pure Python functions. Such
expressions/functions create new Gaussian random variables
while automatically tracking statistical correlations between the new
and old variables. This data type is useful for simple error propagation
but also is heavily used by the Bayesian least-squares fitting module
lsqfit.py (to define priors and specify fit results, while accounting
for correlations between all variables).

This package uses numpy for efficient array arithmetic, and cython to
compile efficient core routines and interface code.
